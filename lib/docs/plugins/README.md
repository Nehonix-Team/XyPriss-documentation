## Welcome to the XyPriss Plugin Ecosystem

Plugins in XyPriss are more than just middleware—they are fully integrated, secure modules that hook deep into the framework's lifecycle. Built with a **Capability-Based Security Model**, the plugin ecosystem allows developers to extend the server's functionality while guaranteeing system-wide stability and security.

### Why Use XyPriss Plugins?

If you are wondering _"Why should I build a plugin instead of just writing middleware?"_, here is why:

1. **Complete Lifecycle Integration**: Plugins can initialize database connections on server start, monitor traffic in real-time, and gracefully shut down resources when the server stops.
2. **Zero-Trust Security**: Each plugin runs in a sandboxed `PluginServer` proxy. They cannot maliciously alter your global application instance, and they cannot read sensitive server configurations without explicit permission.
3. **High Performance**: Plugins are executed based on targeted phases (`NETWORK`, `SECURITY`, `CACHE`), ensuring that XyPriss maintains its ultra-fast throughput without overhead.
4. **Reusability & Ecosystem**: Legitimate XyPriss plugins can be published to the community (npm/XFPM) and instantly integrated by thousands of developers.

## Core Philosophy: Secure by Default

The XyPriss philosophy insists that extending your application should never mean compromising it.

When you add a plugin to your XyPriss app, you do it knowing that:

- It **cannot** overwrite your core server properties.
- It **cannot** read your sensitive environment variables or configs quietly.
- It **must** declare its intentions, and you hold the final keys to its permissions.

Welcome to a safer, faster, and more modular web.
