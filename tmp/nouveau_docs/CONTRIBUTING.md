## Technical Standards

To maintain the integrity and performance of XyPriss, all contributions must adhere to these standards:

- **Language**: Use TypeScript for all application-layer logic and Go for core engine (XHSC) updates.
- **Modularity**: Code must be modular and maintainable. Avoid monolithic functions or classes.
- **Style**:
    - Maintain a professional and serious tone in all comments and documentation.
    - **No emojis** are permitted in the codebase or documentation.
    - Use `lucide-react` for frontend icons if applicable.
- **Tooling**: Use `xfpm` for dependency management and task execution.

## Contribution Workflow

### 1. Environment Setup

To maintain consistency with the XyPriss security and performance model, contributors must adhere to the following setup:

1.  **Fork** the repository and create a feature branch from `master`.
2.  **Tooling**: Ensure `xfpm` is installed on your system. **npm, yarn, or pnpm are strictly prohibited** for dependency management in this project.
3.  **Native Engine (XHSC)**: You must install the XHSC core in a `bin/` directory at the project root. You can choose one of the following methods:
    - **Automated (Recommended)**:
        - _Linux/macOS_: `curl -sL https://dll.nehonix.com/repo/xypriss/install-xhsc.sh | bash`
        - _Windows_: `iwr -useb https://dll.nehonix.com/repo/xypriss/install-xhsc.ps1 | iex`
    - **Manual**: Download the binary for your platform from [http://dll.nehonix.com/repo/xypriss/xhsc/bin](http://dll.nehonix.com/repo/xypriss/xhsc/bin), create a `bin/` folder at the root, and save the binary as `xhsc` (or `xhsc.exe` on Windows).
4.  **Initialization**: Execute `xfpm install` to resolve dependencies and link the native core.

### 2. Implementation & Validation

1.  **Develop** your changes following the technical standards mentioned above.
2.  **Mandatory Simulation**: Every contribution must be accompanied by a simulation project located in the `simulations/` directory (e.g., `simulations/your-feature`).
3.  **Simulation Architecture**: Your simulation must follow the architecture of `simulations/XCIS`:
    - **TypeScript Configuration**: The `tsconfig.json` must map the `xypriss` module to the local source: `"xypriss": ["../../src/index.ts"]`.
    - **Dependency Management**: The simulation's `package.json` **must not** include `xypriss` in the `dependencies` list.
4.  **Pre-Submission Testing**: Implement the necessary routes, tests, and scenarios within your simulation to verify and approve the feature before opening a Pull Request.

### 3. Submission

1.  Ensure your branch is up-to-date with the upstream `master`.
2.  Submit a **Pull Request (PR)** with a concise, technical description of the changes and a link to your simulation for review.
3.  Link the PR to the relevant issue using "Closes #issue-number".

## Pull Request Guidelines

- **Atomic Commits**: Keep commits focused on a single logical change.
- **Documentation**: Update relevant `.md` files in `docs/` if your change affects the public API or behavior.
- **No Breaking Changes**: If a breaking change is necessary, it must be explicitly highlighted in the PR description for architectural review.

## Security Disclosures

Do not report security vulnerabilities through public issues. To report a security concern, please contact our security team at [support@team.nehonix.com](mailto:support@team.nehonix.com).
