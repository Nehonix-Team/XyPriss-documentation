# Plugin Request Data Masking

XyPriss implements a proactive security measure to protect sensitive user data from being intercepted by plugins. This is achieved through **Request Data Masking**, which restricts access to specific request properties within plugin hooks.

## Overview

While plugins are powerful tools for extending server functionality, they often do not need access to the full content of a request (such as passwords in a body or session tokens in cookies) to perform their tasks (e.g., logging response times or detecting attacks).

To adhere to the **Principle of Least Privilege**, XyPriss automatically masks sensitive fields in the `Request` object before passing it to most plugin hooks.

## Masked Fields

The following properties of the `req` (Request) object are masked:

- **req.body**: The parsed body of the request (passwords, PII).
- **req.query**: The URL query parameters (tokens, emails).
- **req.cookies**: The parsed cookies (session IDs, JWTs).
- **req.params**: The route parameters.
- **req.headers**: HTTP headers (Authorization, X-Forwarded-For).

When a plugin without the proper permission attempts to access these fields, it will receive a standard informational string instead of the actual data:

`Access to sensitive request data is restricted in this hook for security reasons. Requires XHS.PERM.SECURITY.SENSITIVE_DATA permission.`

## Unmasking Data (Opt-In Security)

If a plugin legitimately requires access to these fields (e.g., a rate limiter reading a custom header, or an analytics plugin reading a cookie), the server administrator must explicitly grant the `XHS.PERM.SECURITY.SENSITIVE_DATA` permission.

```jsonc
{
    "$internal": {
        "my-analytics-plugin": {
            "permissions": {
                "allowedHooks": [
                    "XHS.HOOK.HTTP.REQUEST",
                    "XHS.PERM.SECURITY.SENSITIVE_DATA",
                ],
                "policy": "allow",
            },
        },
    },
}
```

By enforcing this as an explicit **opt-in**, we maintain a Zero-Trust security posture while still allowing maximum extensibility.

## Affected Hooks

Data masking is applied to the following hooks in the `XyPrissPlugin` interface:

- `onRequest`
- `onResponse`
- `onError`
- `onSecurityAttack`
- `onResponseTime`
- `onRouteError`
- `onRateLimit`

## Why Masking?

1.  **Security**: Prevents malicious or poorly coded plugins from leaking sensitive user information (PII, credentials, etc.).
2.  **Privacy**: Ensures that user data is only handled by the core application logic unless explicitly necessary.
3.  **Compliance**: Helps in meeting regulatory requirements (like GDPR or PCI-DSS) by limiting data exposure.

## Impact on Application Logic

This masking **only affects plugins**. The main application logic (route handlers, controllers, and core middleware) continues to have full, unmasked access to all request data.

## Best Practices for Plugin Developers

If your plugin requires access to specific request data to function, consider the following:

- **Routing Data**: The `req.path` and `req.method` remain accessible unconditionally.
- **Explicit Documentation**: If your plugin requires `ACCESS_SENSITIVE_DATA` (for instance, to read `req.headers` or `req.body`), you **must** clearly document this requirement in your plugin's `README.md`. Server administrators will not be able to use your plugin effectively if you fail to inform them of the security permissions required.
- **Core Integration**: If a feature absolutely requires raw data access across the entire app and is too sensitive for the plugin system, it should be implemented as part of the core application or via a trusted internal module.
